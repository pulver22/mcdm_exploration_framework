# topoNBS

This branch contains a ROS-implementation of [Next-Best-Sense](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9113679) adapted for working on topological maps.
It relies on the ROS package [bayesian_topological_localisation](https://github.com/francescodelduchetto/topological_navigation/tree/master/bayesian_topological_localisation) for updating the belief over the objects tracked.

A video of the working principle of topoNBS combined with a topological particle filter for localizing human pickers in a polytunnel is hosted on YouTube.
